# Pong

This is my Python (pygame) version of the most popular video game in the world: Pong !

The game controls are : W/S (or Z/S) for P1 and UP/DOWN for P2. (and sorry for french annotations and some french named variables, I was tired ahah)

If you just want to play the game, you can download " Pong_Setup.exe " and install it.
